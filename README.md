## About the Project

This project is part of the **Inversity Team Challenge #3**, titled *"How can AI make education more engaging, effective, and equitable?"*. The challenge, running from November 10th to December 1st, explores innovative AI solutions to transform education, supported by Rehana Al-Soltane, AI Learning Manager at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and impactful AI applications.

Sponsored by [Faculty](https://faculty.ai), one of Europe's leading AI companies, this challenge invites teams of 3-5 to contribute ideas that can positively reshape education through responsible AI use.
